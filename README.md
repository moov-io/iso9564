# moov-io/pinblock

The `pinblock` package implements Personal Identifiation (PIN) managment and security.

A block of data used to encapsulate a PIN during processing. The PIN block format defines the content of the PIN block and how it is processed to retrieve the PIN. The PIN block is composed of the PIN, the PIN length, and may contain subset of the PAN. Their are many formats for PIN blocks that are network and processor dependent. Regardless the data is shipped in [ISO8583](https://github.com/moov-io/iso8583) field 52.

## Project status

Moov pinblock currently offers a Go package that support decode and encode features for a lot of pinblock formats. Feedback on this early version of the project is appreciated and vital to its success. Please let us know if you encounter any bugs/unclear documentation or have feature suggestions by opening up an issue. Thanks!

## Go library

This project uses [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) and Go v1.18 or newer. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help in setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/pinblock/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.


### Installation

```
go get github.com/moov-io/pinblock
```

### Supported pin blocks

- [x] ISO 9564-1 Format 0
- [x] ISO 9564-1:2003 Format 1
- [x] ISO 9564-3: 2003 Format 2
- [x] ISO 9564-1: 2002 Format 3
- [x] ANSI X9.8
- [x] OEM-1 (Diebold, Docutel, NCR)
- [x] ECI-1, ECI-2, ECI-3, ECI-4

## Usage

All the pin block types implemented based on two different interfaces
```
type FormatA interface {
	SetDebugWriter(writer io.Writer)
	Encode(pin, account string) (string, error)
	Decode(pinBlock, account string) (string, error)
}

type FormatB interface {
	SetDebugWriter(writer io.Writer)
	Encode(pin string) (string, error)
	Decode(pinBlock string) (string, error)
}
```
FormatA used pin and pan code for encrypt operation and decode operation, but FormatB used pin code only.
Generally user can not access code block instance (struct instance), should use via interface 

There are some global functions to get pin blocker instance

```
func NewISO0() FormatA
func NewISO1() FormatB
func NewISO2() FormatB
func NewISO3() FormatA
func NewISO4(cipher Cipher) FormatA
func NewANSIX98() FormatA
func NewOEM1() FormatB
func NewECI1() FormatA
func NewECI2() FormatB
func NewECI3() FormatB
func NewECI4() FormatB
func NewVISA1() FormatA
func NewVISA2() FormatB
func NewVISA3() FormatB
func NewVISA4() FormatA
```

To use a set of method signatures according to interface is very easy
```
		pin := "1234"
		account := "5432101234567891"
		
		iso0 := formats.NewISO0()
		pinBlock, err := iso0.Encode(pin, account)
		...
		pin, err := iso0.Decode(pinBlock, account)
		...
```

Especially pin block of iso-4 required that pin block is encrypted with AES key.
To support this type, encryption logic implemented in moov pinblock package
```
		cipher, err := encryption.NewAesECB([]byte("1234567890123456"))
		iso4 := NewISO4(cipher)
		pinBlock, err := iso4.Encode("12344", "432198765432109870")
		pin, err := iso4.Decode(pinBlock, "432198765432109870")
```

User can get debug messages that describe operation status intuitively with SetDebugWriter() function.
```
		pin := "1234"
		account := "5432101234567891"
		iso0 := formats.NewISO0()
		out := bytes.NewBuffer([]byte{})
		iso0.SetDebugWriter(out)
		pinBlock, err := iso0.Encode(pin, account)
		fmt.Println(out.String())
		
		out.Reset()
		
		pin, err := iso0.Decode(pinBlock, account)
		fmt.Println(out.String())
		
```

Expected output messages from above code.
```
